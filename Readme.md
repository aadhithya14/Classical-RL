# RL-Research
After a year of exploring the field as a beginner, I think I have approximated a near optimal policy of how to start learning Reinforcement learning for a beginner from a researchers point of view. This repository is to share my RL journey and resources so that you can get an insight on how to learn how to learn.This repository focuses on the mathematical aspects of reinforcement learning and the implementation point of view.

I have included:

- [x] Python implementations of various topics in sequential order.
- [x] Free Resources that I found to be helpful(Video lecture links, online articles and blogs).

Please feel free to open up a PR if you think you have more sources or notes to share .
