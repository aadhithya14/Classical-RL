# RLResearch

In my journey through Reinforcement Learning I have learnt that it is often very difficult to find the sources for various topics.This repository is a collection of various algorithms and concepts which one would need who is interested in learning Reinforcement learning basics.

It includes the following things:-

- [x] Links of sources of all the topics

- [x] Concepts and algorithms as hackmd notes

- [x] Python implementations of various algorithms
