# TD LEARNING

It is a sample based algorithm which uses features of both Monte-Carlo and Dynamic Programming methods. Like Monte Carlo methods, TD methods can learn directly from raw experience without a model of the environmentâ€™s dynamics. Like DP, TD methods update estimates based in part on other learned estimates, without waiting for a final outcome (they bootstrap).
