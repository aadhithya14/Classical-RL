# FINITE MARKOV DECISION PROCESS AND BELLMAN EQUATIONS

This marks the beginning of the Full Reinforcement Learning. In this unit we are introduced to  the three building blocks of  any reinforcement learning problem, State,Actions and Rewards. We  also learn about Agent-Environment interaction in a reinforcement learning problem.

I have attached my hackmd notes of this topic below. It has the intuitions to all concepts as well as the mathematical proof for its existence.
