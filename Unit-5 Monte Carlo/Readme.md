# MONTE CARLO METHODS

This is one of the sample based methods which solves Model Free Reinforcement Learning Problems

When we don't know the system dynamics and transition probabilities of a model we can apply this

algorithm. The pros and cons of this method are addressed in the hackmd  notes below.

I have implemented the following algorithms:

- [x] On-policy Monte-Carlo using Non Exploring starts(Epsilon-Soft policy) using BlackJack environment.
